/*
    TinyWireM Library: Arduino-Uno-Side (Slave)
    -------------------------------------------

    INTRODUCTION
    ------------

    The following sketch provides a simple example of setting up an ATtiny84A as an I2C Bus Master
    and an Arduino Uno as a Slave device located at I2C address 100.

    At runtime, the ATtiny Master will send successive bytes to the Arduino Slave which will then
    print them out using the Serial Monitor.


    HW SETUP
    --------

    - Connect Arduino Pin A4 (HW SDA) to ATtiny84A Pin PA0 (SW SDA) with a 2K2 pull-up resistor to 5V
    - Connect Arduino Pin A5 (HW SCL) to ATtiny84A Pin PA5 (SW SCL) with a 2K2 pull-up resistor to 5V
    - Follow the basic hookup for Arduino & ATtiny84A (Common Ground for both ICs, 100nF decoupling capacitors,
      10K pullup resistors for RESET pins, and if needed, external crystals)


    RUNNING THE SKETCH
    ------------------

    Upload this sketch to the Arduino Uno and the other example sketch (ATtiny84A_Master.ino) to the
    ATtiny84A. Then open the Serial Monitor (make sure the Baud Rate is set to 9600).
