/*
    TinyWireM Library: ATtiny84a-Side (Master)
    ------------------------------------------

    INTRODUCTION
    ------------

    The following sketch provides a simple example of setting up an ATtiny84A as an I2C Bus Master
    and an Arduino Uno as a Slave device located at I2C address 100.

    At runtime, the ATtiny Master will send 10 successive bytes with values 0-10 to the Arduino Slave
    which will then print them out using the Serial Monitor.


    HW SETUP
    --------

    - Connect Arduino Pin A4 (HW SDA) to ATtiny84A Pin PA0 (SW SDA) with a 2K2 pull-up resistor to 5V
    - Connect Arduino Pin A5 (HW SCL) to ATtiny84A Pin PA5 (SW SCL) with a 2K2 pull-up resistor to 5V
    - Follow the basic hookup for Arduino & ATtiny84A (Common ground for both ICs, 100nF decoupling capacitors,
      10K pullup resistors for RESET pins, and if needed, external crystals)


    RUNNING THE SKETCH
    ------------------

    Upload this sketch to the ATtiny84A and the other example sketch (Arduino_Uno_Slave.ino) to the
    Arduino. Then open the Serial Monitor (make sure the Baud Rate is set to 9600).
