## INTRODUCTION

This library enables members of the ATtiny family to become an I2C Bus Master. The library is based on a software implementation of I2C which is slower than the hardware one, but nevertheless allows the user to set any of the ATtiny pins as SDA & SCL.

## REPOSITORY CONTENTS

- **TinyWireM.h** - Library Header file.
- **/utility** 
    - **TinyWireM_USI.h** - Header file with the software TWI-USI functionality (contains SDA & SCL pin number definitions, I2C bus speed, etc.)
- **/examples**  
    - **/TinyWireM_Example**
        - **/ATtiny84A_Master**
            - **ATtiny84A_Master.ino** - Master-Side: A basic sketch implementing the ATtiny84A as I2C Master        - **/ATtiny841_Master**
            - **ATtiny841_Master.ino** - Master-Side: A basic sketch implementing the ATtiny841 as I2C Master  
        - **Arduino_Uno_Slave** 
            - **Arduino_Uno_Slave.ino** - Slave-Side: A basic sketch implementing the Arduino Uno as I2C slave  
- **/extras** 
    - **License.txt** - A copy of the end-user license agreement.  
- **keywords.txt** - Keywords for this library which will be highlighted in sketches within the Arduino IDE. 
- **library.properties** - General library properties for the Arduino's IDE (>1.5) Library Package Manager.
- **README.md** - The readme file for this library.
- **library.json** - JSON file for the Arduino's IDE (>1.5) Package Manager.


## GENERAL NOTES

This library follows the convetions of the Arduino's built-in [Wire](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/tree/master/hardware/arduino/avr/libraries/Wire) library, with only 'TinyWireM' replacing the 'Wire' keyword. Hence, for example, use TinyWireM.begin() to join the I2C Bus as Master, or TinyWireM.requestFrom(SLAVE_ADDR, NUM_BYTES) to request a certain number of bytes from one of the Slave devices on the bus.
